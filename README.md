BlockDude
=========

The classic TI-OS PuzzPack game, ported into PuzzleScript. If you haven't heard of it before, you can read the original version's documentation [here](http://www.detachedsolutions.com/puzzpack/blockdude.php).

## How to play
Simply open index.html in any HTML5-compatible web browser and start playing! Use the arrow keys to move and X or SPACE to pick up/put down blocks. You can restart a level by pressing R or undo a move by pressing Z.

If you are on a mobile device, you can use the mobile.html file instead. It uses [this virtual pad](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2013/11/27/add-a-virtual-pad-to-play-your-hml5-games-made-with-puzzlescript-on-mobile-devices/) to make the game playable without a keyboard.
